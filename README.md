Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Global Layoffs Dataset
I performed in-depth SQL-based exploratory analysis to identify trends, outliers, and industry-wide impacts of workforce layoffs. 
Analyzed maximum layoffs, 100% shutdown cases, layoffs by company, industry, country, and funding stage. 
Built aggregate reports with GROUP BY, CTEs, and window functions to rank top companies per year and calculate rolling totals over time.
